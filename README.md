## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Multi-model ensemble**: Combines predictions from BERT, LSTM, GRU with a custom meta-engine.
- 🧠 **Transformer embeddings**: BERT-based embeddings boost semantic signal detection.
- 🧩 **Preprocessing pipeline**: Cleans, tokenizes, and stems text with NLTK and Transformers.
- 🌐 **Conversational validation**: Uses Mistral chat completion for external spam assumptions and reasoning.
- 📈 **Dynamic training strategy**: Automatically balances model weights across retraining sessions.
- 🗃️ **Storage engine**: Persists enriched spam-labeled messages for future reuse.
- 🔧 **Extensible design**: Built for integration into LangChain/LangGraph workflows.
